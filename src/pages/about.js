    <p>
      Imaginary Radio Stations is a project by three Slovenian music enthusiasts, DJs and artists, founded in Berlin. Its existence is as an expression of pure intent without fitting into flavor-of-the-week hype columns, purist approaches and associated microscenes. The aim is timelessness, always inspired by concrete ambients, settings and states of mind, beckoning the wandering ear to tune in. Its concept reflects the commodification and atomization of music culture. By blurring the lines between genres and styles, producers and consumers it mirrors a fragmented culture of innumerable acteurs where everyone curates their own imaginary radio.
