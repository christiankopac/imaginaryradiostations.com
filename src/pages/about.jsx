        Imaginary Radio Stations is a project by three Slovenian music
        enthusiasts, DJs and artists, founded in Berlin. Its existence is as an
        expression of pure intent without fitting into flavor-of-the-week hype
        columns, purist approaches and associated microscenes. The aim is
        timelessness, always inspired by concrete ambients, settings and states
        of mind, beckoning the wandering ear to tune in. Its concept reflects
        the commodification and atomization of music culture. By blurring the
        lines between genres and styles, producers and consumers it mirrors a
        fragmented culture of innumerable acteurs where everyone curates their
        own imaginary radio.

        playing in punk bands, sparking his interest in playing and creating
        music. Enchanted by Detroit techno and electro around Y2K, he soon
        embraced influences from all across the musical spectrum, leading to the
        formation of various alter-egos to accomodate different output.
        Co-founder of Scienceofuse, an independent electronic music collective /
        record label (2006-2016) and the infamous Gumitwist club nights at the
        legendary Klub K4, co-shaping the Ljubljana electronic music scene from

        frequently appearing at Elektroliza, an influential electro night at
        club Channel Zero in Ljubljana. Over the last 15+ years he has played
        numerous DJ / live sets which makes him equally adept at dictating a
        sweaty dancefloor or curating a listening experience. Co-founded
        Imaginary Radio Stations in Berlin (2017).
