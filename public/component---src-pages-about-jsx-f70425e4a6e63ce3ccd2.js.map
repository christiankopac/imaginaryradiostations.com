Its existence is as an\n        expression of pure intent without fitting into flavor-of-the-week hype\n        columns, purist approaches and associated microscenes. The aim is\n        timelessness, always inspired by concrete ambients, settings and states\n        of mind, beckoning the wandering ear to tune in. Its concept reflects\n        the commodification and atomization of music culture. By blurring the\n        lines between genres and styles, producers and consumers it mirrors a\n        fragmented culture of innumerable acteurs where everyone curates their\n        own imaginary radio.\n      </p>\n\n      <Title>CP-AK</Title>\n      <p>\n        {/* eslint-disable-next-line max-len */}\n        CP-AK is a DJ and music enthusiast from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
